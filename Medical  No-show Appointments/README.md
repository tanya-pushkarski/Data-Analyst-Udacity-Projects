This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.

**The main question for this dataset is: What factors are important to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment?**

To find an answer to this question I'll go through more specific questions such as:

1. What percent of patients not show up to an appointment?
2. Patients with what kind of characteristics are more tend to not come to an appointment?
3. What average age of patients who don't show up? Does average age differ in genders?
4. Does percent of "no show" cases is different for gender?
5. Does percent of "no show" cases depend on neighbourhood?
6. Does "no show" cases depend on the gap between scheduled day and appointment day?
7. Does sms help patients to attend an appointment or not?
