# Data Analyst Portfolio Project Repository
This Repository is holding all of the code and queries for the Portfolio Projects I'm creating.

## Analyze A/B Results
**Tools:** Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, Scipy

This poject was completed as part of Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree. In this project, I have worked through to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The goal is to help the company understand if they should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Exploring Weather Trends 
**Tools:** SQL, Google Sheets

This poject was completed as part of Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree. In this project, I've used a bit of SQL to download data from Udacity portal, also used Google Sheets to analyze global/local temperature, and to compare trends.
