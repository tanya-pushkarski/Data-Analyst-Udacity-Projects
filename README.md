# Data Analyst Portfolio Project Repository
This Repository is holding all of the code and queries for the Portfolio Projects I'm creating.

## Exploring Weather Trends 
**Tools:** Python, SQL, Google Sheets<br>

This poject was completed as part of Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree. In this project, I've used a bit of SQL to download data from Udacity portal, also used Google Sheets to analyze global/local temperature, and to compare trends.
