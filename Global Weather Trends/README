Tools: Python, SQL, Google Sheets

This poject was completed as part of Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree. In this project, I've used a bit of SQL to download data from Udacity portal, 
also used Google Sheets to analyze global/local temperature, and to compare trends.

The folder contain two files:
1. Global Weather Trends (Google Sheet).ods
2. Exploring Weather Trends Steps and Conclusion.pdf
