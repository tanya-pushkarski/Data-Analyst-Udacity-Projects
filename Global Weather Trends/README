Tools: Python, SQL, Google Sheets

This poject was completed as part of Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree. In this project, I've used a bit of SQL to download data from Udacity portal, 
also used Google Sheets to analyze global/local temperature, and to compare trends.

Colculations and visualisations were made in Google Sheets, please check "Global Weather Trends (Google Sheet).ods" file.
