This poject was completed as a part of Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree. In the project, I've used a bit of SQL to download data from Udacity portal, and Google Sheets to analyze global/local temperature, and to compare trends.

**Tools:** SQL, Google Sheets

Calculations and visualisations were made in Google Sheets, please check **"Global Weather Trends (Google Sheet).ods"** file.
